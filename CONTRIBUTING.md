# How to contribute

* Write code
* Add tests
* Run tests
* Run pylint
* Send a pull request

## Testing

Tests are automatically run in [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/marhag87/c20). You are expected to add tests for code you write, where it makes sense.

## Submitting changes

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes.
